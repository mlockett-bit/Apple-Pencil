## üçè macOS Automation with AppleScript

While the iPad app handles **drawing + vector export**, we also provide a set of **AppleScript helpers** to make your workflow on macOS faster and more automated.

### üîß What AppleScript Does
- Automatically **organize exported SVGs** into a project folder  
- **Batch-open** SVGs in apps like Illustrator, Figma, or Affinity Designer  
- **Convert** SVG ‚Üí PDF or PNG for quick previews  
- **Commit & push** new exports straight to your GitHub repo  

---

### üìÇ Scripts Included
Located in `macos-scripts/`:

- `auto-open.scpt` ‚Üí Opens all new SVGs in Illustrator  
- `auto-commit.scpt` ‚Üí Runs `git add . && git commit && git push` for new exports  
- `convert-to-pdf.scpt` ‚Üí Converts all SVG files in a folder into PDFs

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running a Script
1. Open **Script Editor** on macOS  
2. Load the `.scpt` file from `macos-scripts/`  
3. Click **Run**


---

üëâ This way, anyone browsing your repo sees **iPad app + Mac automation as one full pipeline**.  

Do you also want me to create a **sample AppleScript (`auto-open.scpt`) file** you can drop into your repo‚Äôs `macos-scripts/` folder, ready to run?


Or, from Terminal:
```bash
osascript macos-scripts/auto-open.scpt
